New test case running approach: 
    - build and create docker container with user code one time
    - loop over test cases and do:
        -run our cpp program inside it with test case
        - get result and compare it with our expected output
        - measure the time of the run
        - set time out to kill the container if TLE
        - measure memory usage (Some how) and check if MLE
        - if violates any Rule (WA || TLE || MLE || RTE)
            - break the loop 
            - update submission database by setting the enw status of submmission as (WA, TLE, etc)

    - every thing passed update the submission database with dtstus AC
